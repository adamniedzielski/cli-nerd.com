title: "Great Books: Read Yourself a Little History of Computing"

I've recently got obsessed with reading books about the history of computing. Since then I've discovered fascinating stories about electrical
engineering, personal computers and the internet. This is a compilation of my favorite books on these topics.

Being born in the 1990s I kind of missed out on many of these and thus I had quite some catchup work in front of me. Each and every book
helped to shape my understanding of our current world and I wouldn't want to miss any of them. Since I had been asked about my favorites a
couple of times by colleagues, I decided to put together this list.

I tried to group the books into categories and ordered them by the years they cover. You can read them all
from top to bottom or just pick whichever you're most interested in. You'll be surprised how many cross-references
there are and how some of the characters and places are mentioned over and over again.

Ah, and before I forget: If you know other books that you think should be on this list, please [let me know](https://twitter.com/damienklinnert)!
