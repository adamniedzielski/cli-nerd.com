A couple of days ago, I stumbled over the following question:

> What have you done to make the world a better place?

This is a simple question. It’s only a couple of words. You don’t need to be incredibly creative or spend hours reasoning about ethics; answering it should be as straightforward as jotting down a bullet point list.

However, this particular question popped up in my mind over and over again. Every time, I pushed it back to the place it came from by listing some additional things I’ve done in the past. Unsurprisingly, I quickly ran out of answers and thus had to face the truth: I should be doing more. Hell, I felt like I wasn't doing anything at all. I felt terrible.

Following this realisation, I came up with a list of things I could be doing. Among various other ideas, one of the bullet points read “share knowledge”. Granted, sharing knowledge doesn’t sound like the most effective way to make the world a better place, but it has the potential to empower others to do so.

Undoubtedly, I could try to share my knowledge about programming computers (as this is the only topic I know about really). Even though it’s a large field and I consider myself far from being an expert in computer science, I’m confident that I can share some insights into the ideas, concepts and technologies that I frequently find to be valuable.

This is what this blog will be about.
