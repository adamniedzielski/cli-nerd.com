This is the source for my developer blog. The actual website is generated from this source via
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).


## Contributing new Content

To write and preview new content for the blog, you'll need `ruby`, rubygems and the `jekyll` gem installed on your
machine.

Then checkout this repository and run `jekyll serve` from the root of the project. This will spin up a live preview
of the blog that you can access by pointing your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`.

To publish new content, simply push it to the branch `gh-pages` on github. github will take care of the rest.
